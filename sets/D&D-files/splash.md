A journey through my history of D&D games. These are all games I have run and each has its own abbreviations:<soft-line>
1. TLD — The Legendary Defenders: A timetravel based campaign set around returning the four elemental orbs (Water, Earth, Fire, and Wind) to the elemental plane before they consumed the universe.
2. TFF — The Formidable Five: This is my main campaign set in Cephestia, my homebrew world, that centers around the conflict of the gods and the Holy Kingdom on Nastrax invasion of the Oclea Alliance (House Ostrix, House Malaas, and House Aurelia)<soft-line>
3. ER — Eastern Reach: This was a west marches style campaign I ran for 3 years or so set in the distant future in Cephestia after the gods had been banished in the far eastern continent.
4. CoS — Curse of Strahd: I ran this for a goup.
5. CEP — Cephestia: This is my general tag for cards related to my homebrew world, but not explicitly part of any of the campaigns.

Other expansion may be added later, but they will likely be separated out... maybe.</soft-line></soft-line>
